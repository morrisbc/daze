# Daze
A web application to help those that are feeling slow throughout their days.

# Motivation
Recently I've found myself waking up in a *daze* most mornings and having a hard
time getting the things done that I'd like to. This application exists in order
to keep track of some common causes like lack of sleep, calories, and physical
activity.

# Features

## Current
- Add nights of sleep consisting of your bed time, wake time, common tags, and
  personal notes
- View the previous seven nights of sleep consisting of your average hours
  over those nights and how they compare to your sleep goal per night
- Set goals for your amount of sleep, calories, and physical activity

## Planned
- Adding physical activity minutes with similar overview to that of sleep
- Adding the food you're consuming along with thier calorie values
- Overview of previous day's calories similar to that of sleep
